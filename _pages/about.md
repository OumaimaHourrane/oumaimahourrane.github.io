Hi! I'm Oumaima Hourrane — Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco.

My work focuses on Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and the ethical design of intelligent systems. I’m particularly interested in how language, meaning, and fairness intersect in machine learning, and how we can build systems that are both powerful and responsible.

On this site, you’ll find an overview of my research, teaching, and creative projects. I also occasionally write about AI, education, and the curious intersections between tech, language, and society.

Thanks for visiting!
