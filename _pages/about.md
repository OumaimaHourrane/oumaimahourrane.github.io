Hi, Iâ€™m Oumaima, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco.

I work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and tech ethics. My research explores how language, meaning, and fairness shape machine learning, and how we can design systems that are not only intelligent but also responsible.

This site highlights my research, teaching, and creative work. I also write occasionally about AI, education, and the intriguing crossroads where technology meets language and society.

Thanks for visiting!
